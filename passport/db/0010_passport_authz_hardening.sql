-- 0010 — passport authorization hardening, PART 1 of 2: ADDITIVE ONLY.
--
-- Applying this file changes NO existing behaviour. It adds the server-side
-- authorization primitives that 0011 then switches the RLS over to. Split in two
-- deliberately: tightening RLS before the app is deployed against these RPCs
-- would break student scanning and the admin panel instantly.
--
--   0010 (this file) — helpers + stamp RPC + leaderboard RPC + profiles guard
--   app deploy       — scanning.js and admin-page.js start using them
--   0011             — the actual lockdown (drops the `:: true` write policies)
--
-- Apply with samoweb's tools/apply-migration.mjs (Management API, superuser).
-- Proof: samoweb tools/pass-hardening.mjs — it applies 0011 INSIDE a rolled-back
-- transaction, so the lockdown is proven before it is ever committed.
--
-- Context: every passport write policy is `:: true` for the public role today and
-- the bundled anon key reaches this schema, so with nothing but the key from the
-- JS bundle an anonymous visitor can award themselves arbitrary km, edit or wipe
-- anyone's scans, flip the current วาระ/season, and dump every student's name +
-- email. See SECURITY-HARDENING-PLAN.md §1.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 0. Read this before writing any `grant` below
-- ===========================================================================
-- This schema carries ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES (granted by postgres):
--     functions -> anon=X, authenticated=X
--     tables    -> anon=arwdDxtm, authenticated=arwdDxtm
--     sequences -> anon=rwU, authenticated=rwU
-- Two consequences that bit during this migration:
--   1. Every function created here is EXECUTABLE BY anon the instant it exists,
--      and `revoke all ... from public` does NOT undo that — PUBLIC and anon are
--      different grantees, so the explicit `anon=X` survives the revoke. Any
--      function that must not be anon-callable needs `revoke ... from anon` BY
--      NAME. (Verify with `select proacl from pg_proc`, never by assuming.)
--   2. Every future TABLE in this schema is fully anon-writable unless its RLS
--      says otherwise, so RLS is not defence-in-depth here — it is the only
--      defence. A new passport table with RLS off, or on with a `:: true`
--      policy, is world-writable on creation.
-- The two policy helpers below KEEP their anon grant on purpose: RLS policy
-- expressions are evaluated with the querying role's privileges, so if anon
-- could not execute passport.is_admin() every policy calling it would fail with
-- "permission denied for function" instead of returning false.

-- ===========================================================================
-- 1. Admin identity — the ทีม SAMO org tree is the ONLY source of truth
-- ===========================================================================
-- There is deliberately NO passport.admins table. samoweb migration 0087 already
-- resolves passport admin-ness from the org tree into
-- public.passport_admin_context(): is_admin = the blanket `passport` permission
-- or role='dev' (=> all_departments true) OR any users.managed_passport_scopes
-- entry ('d:<id>' / 's:<id>'). A second admin table would be a competing grant
-- channel that the ทีม SAMO permission UI cannot see — the "two representations
-- of one grant" bug class in samoweb .claude/rules/mistakes.md.
--
-- passport_admin_context() already returns is_admin=false for a null auth.uid(),
-- so an anonymous caller is refused before any scope is considered.

-- 2. stamp_scan — the ONLY way a scan may be created once 0011 lands
-- ===========================================================================
-- Moves three decisions the client currently makes onto the server:
--   * the QR token check (today `isStaticMatch` in scanning.js — client-side only,
--     so self-stamping without attending is a one-line DevTools edit);
--   * points_awarded (today sent by the client, and handle_new_scan trusts it —
--     so any km could be awarded); now read from activities.base_points_km;
--   * user_id (today sent by the client) — now always auth.uid().
--
-- It ALSO enforces the kkumail-only rule server-side. That gate lives in
-- js/auth.js getPassportAccess today and is therefore advisory: a signed-in
-- non-kkumail (or migrated-away) account can call the RPC directly. NOTE this is
-- a second implementation of that rule — if ALLOWED_DOMAINS / DEV_ALLOWLIST /
-- the account_migrations semantics change in js/auth.js, change it here too.
-- (samoweb mistakes.md: "two implementations of one rule drift silently".) The
-- server is the boundary; the client copy stays only for the friendlier UI.
--
-- ⛔ DO NOT RUN THIS FILE STANDALONE ON A DATABASE THAT HAS ALREADY APPLIED
-- samoweb's supabase/migrations/0180_an_activity_belongs_to_its_season.sql (or
-- its 0214 port of this hardening). 0180 later `create or replace`s this SAME
-- function to add the SEASON_CLOSED guard (a QR from a finished quarter must
-- not stamp). This file's version below has no such check — re-running it
-- (e.g. standing up a fresh database by replaying every passport/db/*.sql file
-- in order after supabase/migrations has already landed) SILENTLY reverts
-- that guard, reopening "a QR from a finished quarter still awards km
-- forever" with no error and no visible symptom until someone notices an old
-- QR still works. If you are applying migrations to a database that already
-- has 0180/0214, skip this `create or replace` and keep the live definition.

-- 3. profiles column guard — total_km is server-managed
-- ===========================================================================
-- profiles_update_own is `using (auth.uid() = id)`, i.e. row-level with no column
-- policy, so one PATCH sets your own total_km to anything. This is the same class
-- as samoweb users (0028), vs_tickets (0096) and shop_orders (0100): a per-row
-- owner UPDATE policy is a row filter, never a column policy.
--
-- The exemption matters more than the guard. on_new_scan is SECURITY DEFINER, but
-- SECURITY DEFINER does NOT clear auth.uid() (it reads the request.jwt.claims GUC,
-- which is session-scoped), so during a legitimate stamp this trigger fires with
-- the student's own uid and a changed total_km — indistinguishable from the attack
-- by identity alone. It is distinguishable by DEPTH: on_new_scan runs at depth 1,
-- so the profiles UPDATE it issues fires this trigger at depth 2, while a client
-- PATCH arrives at depth 1. A client cannot manufacture depth > 1.
-- (samoweb 0041 is the cautionary twin: a guard that could not tell the server's
-- own sync trigger from a client write bricked every new signup.)

-- 4. admin_leaderboard — replaces "fetch every profile, filter in the browser"
-- ===========================================================================
-- The admin leaderboard is the only reader of profiles.email (admin-page.js
-- ensureLbScans). It currently selects EVERY profile (id, full_name, email) plus
-- every scan and does the department scoping client-side, so a ฝ่าย-scoped admin
-- holds the entire student roster in their tab — and once 0011 closes
-- profiles_read_all that read stops working anyway.
--
-- Decision (2026-07-30): KEEP email. Organizers use it to identify students and
-- to export the ranking. So the scoping moves server-side and the row set is
-- filtered to the caller's own departments before it leaves Postgres. A plain RLS
-- policy cannot express this: passport.profiles has no department column, so
-- "profiles referenced by in-scope scans" is only expressible in a function.
--
-- Ranking is computed here too, so what the browser receives is already the
-- answer rather than the raw material for it.

-- (scans_read is public and the ranking is the point of the feature); the profiles
-- half stops working the moment 0011 closes profiles_read_all, which would leave
-- every rival's name blank.
--
-- So publish a PROJECTION rather than re-opening the table — samoweb's org-chart
-- rule (0086): a visibility flag filters ROWS, and rows carry every column, so the
-- only safe publisher is a function with an explicit column list. Here that list
-- is id + full_name and nothing else: no email (the PII this whole migration
-- exists to close), no total_km, no tier.
--
-- Narrower than today in two further ways: it requires a signed-in caller
-- (the leaderboard lives behind the dashboard login, and anon can read the whole
-- table right now), and it returns only participants — someone who has never
-- scanned anything is not on a leaderboard and so is not disclosed at all.

-- 5. user_tiers — stop the view from bypassing profiles RLS
-- ===========================================================================
-- passport.user_tiers is a plain view over passport.profiles, owned by postgres,
-- WITHOUT security_invoker — so it reads profiles with the view owner's rights and
-- ignores profiles RLS completely. anon holds SELECT on it. Closing
-- profiles_read_all in 0011 would therefore leak the whole roster anyway
-- (id, full_name, total_km, tier, travel-visa flag) straight through the view:
-- exactly the "sanitizing ONE read path leaves the parallel path leaking" class
-- from samoweb mistakes.md. SECURITY-HARDENING-PLAN.md §3.5 missed this entirely.
--
-- security_invoker = on (PG15+; this project is PG17.6) makes the view respect the
-- caller's RLS. Applied HERE rather than in 0011 because while profiles_read_all
-- is still `using (true)` it is a no-op — the dashboard keeps working either way —
-- and that makes it safe to land early and verify.

alter view passport.user_tiers set (security_invoker = on);

-- ===========================================================================
-- 6. Verification (run as a real user, not as the superuser applying this)
-- ===========================================================================
-- Nothing above is provable from this session: apply-migration.mjs runs as the
-- Postgres superuser, where auth.uid() is null and RLS is bypassed, so every
-- policy and guard here would appear to do nothing. See samoweb
-- tools/pass-hardening.mjs, which impersonates a student / an admin / anon inside
-- rolled-back transactions and additionally applies 0011 in-transaction so the
-- lockdown is proven before it is committed.
